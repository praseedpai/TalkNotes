Existential Re-Incarnation - a  strategy for good Life?
   - "Punarjanma Samhita" ( I was always fascinated with that )
   - Re-incarnation , from younger days

Are yaar, Agale janam meim karenge 

1986, when I was studying for SSLC ( SSC ) , I bunked my class once and saw the movie 
        "Punarjanmam" by KS Sethumadhavan ( Prem Nazir and Jayabharati )

The story line is based on the diaries of "Abraham T Kovoor" 
     Maru Piravi in Tamil 

This movie had a remarkable impact on psyche 


Eagle's re-incarnation 
   - He will shed his tallons , wings and rejuvanates itself 

Existential Re-incarnation means "Jitheji marke Vaapas aana "

Six principles behind Existential Re-incarnation
  a) Invariance principle 
	- Misery of a man is always a Constant - Praseed Pai, Circa 1998
        - The ratio of the "Ability of a Person" and "His Problems" has been a constant
             - Bill gates , Me , You , Beggars, Leppers , Whites, Blacks ...every body things they are smart
        - My Misery Constant is rather high now ( ??? ) - It is a spectrum 

        I am always in Shit, Only depth Varies

  b) Anti-Anthropomorphism 
        - Man is just another species 
        - Men will get extinct some day 

  c) Bounded Rationality 
        - Humans are rational, But it is bounded in nature
        - Herbert Simon, hypothesized it in 1950

  d) Science as a Provisional Belief system
        - Science is a belief system!
        - Falsifiability makes it different from Religion 
  e) Biological determinism
         - Men are too concerned about Social esteem
         - Utlimately, men has to live and pro-create ( Biology over Sociology )

  f) Intellectual Voyeurism
         - Everything is futile ( There is no specific purpose for life )
         - Power of negative thinking ( It helps us in living a positive life )
             - Plan for the Worse, hope for the best 

It is a philosophy for positive living and a good strategy too
   
Rupert Shelldrake's "Science Delusion" , I am convinced that Science is a blief system! ( Provisional truth )
