Knowledge acquistion or Knowledge Curation - Which one is better?

   - Curator is one who collects specimen to a Museum
   - Knowledge Curation is a strategy by which we qcquire Knowledge 
   - Knowledge qcquisition pre-supposes that individual traits do matter

The problem comes from the fact that , most people assume Smartness is due to innate qualities
     of an Individual ( Nature vs Nurture )

In the formative yers, nature does play a role ( at least, correlative role )

But, any kind of advanced competence is the result of deliberate study, exposure, attitude and the 
   problems he or she has solved ( or forced to solve )

In smartness, people ignore the effect of "Randomness" 

  - Why I could write a book on C++ Rx programming?
	- Anoop madhusoodhanan wrote a blog entry in his AmazedSaint.blogspot.com on .NET Rx
        - He was very excited about presenting that topic ( it was in 2011 )
        - Rx = LINQ + Events + Scheduler
        - In 2014, I became part of an engagement where previous Vendor wrote an Input subsystem using Rx model
        - At that point in time, I remembered about Anoop's blog 
        - For a person with hammer, everything is a nail ( I happen to consult in  RxJava project and a WPF project)

        - In 2016, when I wrote C# Design patterns (along with Shine Xavier), we included three chapters on Rx
        - After writing it, I did study Rx implementations across languages
        - In 2017, when packt was looking for an author, I was ready with the proper competence

The problem faced by most people is that , they have not yet solved their Identity problem

          - To curate knowledge, you should shamelessly discuss about various topics
          - If you have not resolved  your identity problem, it is very difficult to ask
          - When you ask too many questions, people might thnk that you do not know much
Once you solve your Identity problem, it is very easy to curate knowledge
          - Otherwise, fear of being accused as a "DODO" will prevent people from asking for information

Even if you get the information, it will be fuzzy and potential anomalies might be there
	- You should have set of Logical tools to distinguish between facts and opinions ( and sometimes errors )
        - One should posses discretionary faculty and should be able to discriminate within each level of description
        - One should be able to empirically verify what has been arrived at

There is something called, "Garbage In, Garbage Out" problem
       - Dialogical techniques helps you to do some kind of a due diligence 
       - By the time you consult authentic sources, you might be thorough with the Ontology
       - Mathematical tools like predicate logic, set theory , algebraic structures and informal logic might be handy
       - One should improve language finsesse as well

We cannot transcend Physical limit, if we do not collaborate with people
Collaboation with people gives you representative facts
In the process, you might acquire lot of Models and Meta Models as well

Ontology callibration is a necessary step while soliciting information
    - Layers are logical entities , where Tier is Physical ( Usual norm or convention )
    - JEE blue prints defines this otherwise 

Problem is the People who act as Knowledge source , use lot of "Anecdotal explanation" with examples galore 
    - Sometimes discussion will drift in different direction
    - The Interviewer should steward the discussion
    - It is always better to have multiple SMEs and Many model thinking ( Or Model driven reality )

==========================================================================================

A) Materialistic world view => Empricial Evidence ( POC ) => They Rationalize
B) Idealistic world view ( based on models ) => Rationalization (Generate and Test ) => Emprical validation (POC)

We should not be "Self Centric" while curating knowledge ( Introspective )
