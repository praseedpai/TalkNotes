A strategy for Critical Thinking

            - Critical Thinking means think and reason in a sound manner using Informal Logic
            - Logic can be divided into Formal ( Symbolic ) and Informal Logic ( Language etc)
            

     Modern men/women are obsessed with Scientific Knowledge
                 - Objective Knowledge ( Vasthu Nishta Jnanam )
                 - Experimentation and Observation 
                 - Repeatable 
                 - Potentially Falisable 
                 - Mathematical Verification 
     Materialistic Conception of the World
                 - Matter is the Primary reality ( Aham Dravyasmi )
                 - Analytical/Reductionistic method of inference is in vogue 
                 - Perception and Deductive Inference is the only source of the Knowledge	
			- Sense Experience and Experiment is the only source of knowledge
                 - Positive approach towards Science (Newtonian world view )
                 - Science has got Common minimum Guarantee in the matters regarding truth ( Physics and Chemistry)

     So called Rationalists ( Actually athiest of Kerala are in fact, Empiricist ) 

     Scientism is a school of thought which believes that Science has got answers to all the problems 

     Science is a provisional truth and there is variation in physical laws even within the universe
     Rupert Shelldrake has written a book titled, "Science Delusion "

=================================================================================

   Axiom #1-   There is always Extra Sensory Knowledge out there
           	- Our senses are survival devices 
           	- Our Visual and Autditory senses are bounded 
          	 - Even with sophisticated devices there is gap in precision measurement
   Axiom #2 - There is nothing called Objective Knowledge 
                - Perception is also some kind of Inference 
                - Human beings are somewhat Goal Oriented ( that colors their vision )
                - Subjective Knowledge is a much better hypotheis when it comes to human beings

   Because of these two Axioms, everybody perceives reality in their own unique ways

   Four Levels of Analysis possible in the case of Human beings
	- Factual Analysis ( Fact truth )
        - Logical truth ( Inference) based on Facts
        - Dialogical truth ( Samvadam between people to understand each other )
              - Lot of Subjective aspects can be uncovered by this method
        - Dialectal truth ( We need to engage in some kind of a debate or tark )
   
   By this time, most premises which survived upto this stage is almost statistically might be true 

   Final Tool to apply is "Neti Neti" ( aka Via Negativa ) 
             - Proof by Counter Example 
             - Proof by Contradiction

   IF some assertions reach this stage, we can be sure about epistemological validy of the assertions

   Sreejith Panicker might be using this technique
