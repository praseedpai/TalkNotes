Parkinson's Law
=================

      - "Work expands, so as to fill the time available for it's completion" - Parkinson's Law
          - Somebody entrusts a task and the duration is two weeks 
		- Even if the task can be finsihed in two days, one will take two weeks
          - People seems to like the rat race to finish

      - Death March - Last two weeks of any project where people get into a war room and finish their tasks
		- A famous CAD/CAM company outsourced application development work to a team headed by me
                - There were relationship issues, as kind of things American engineers do during the death march
                    they forced to do in the earlier stage of the project

      - That particular poject were finshed in a smooth manner and I learned a valuable lesson.
                 Outsourcing is great! ( Not only cost, you can get a robust development process )
                 Beauty of distributed development got manifested

Peter Principle
================
      Lawrence J Peter wrote a influential book titled, "Peter Principle" in 1960/1970
      I learned these maxims at the age of 18,thanks to one Mr. Sabu Paul
      
      In a hierarchy,"Every man rises to his level of incompetence" 
            - A man/woman will move from state of competence to incompetence 
                  - Mohan das Pai was CFO of Infosys. He became CPO of Infosys
                          - Thus began all HR problems there ( it's an allegation )
            - Somebody was good at coding. He will be promoted to become a Team/Tech lead
            - Soon he will be promoted as an Associate Architect ( Technical Architect, Solutions Architect etc )

      According to Praseed Pai, "Any one who has fooled around in the Software Industry for a considerable amount
      of time (ever shrinking span ) , who is past his prime,systematically moved up in the value chain to do 
      least harm"
      
     - Some companies promote people to become architects
	 - In Hindi, "Zaroorat Padne Pe, Gadhe ko bhi baap banana padtha hai"
         - An Owner of a company will confer Architect Position to everyone after first year of their employment
		- It was a clever ploy against the employees, as they won't be hired by others
        
Murphy's law
============
      - Murphy's law states that, "If something has to go wrong, it will (always ) go wrong"
      - Do not fix things, beyond a certain point
      - A system will go from Order to Disorder ( increasing entropy )
      
-------------------------------------------------
    Perpetual Sublimation - Grow horizontally ( do not go verticaly )
                            One needs to innovate to be able to enact this strategy successfully
                            It can be circular growth
    Willfull Poverty - One learn to live "Poor" 

    We can use this for a Positive Living!!!
